Afterthoughs:

I woke up, checked my phone and saw the AoC starts in over a dozen minutes.
I've read the tasks, brushed my teeth and sit down to implementation in few minutes since the question was released.

I tried to take as least time as possible, mostly due to having to drive to work and wanting to check if I could land on the leaderbord.

I'm commiting the code in the same format, as it was when submitting, especially it having some debug code inside, as I see that this may have some value, probably as a retrospective to me.

A shorthand way of dropping parenthesis bite me while writing the solution, as I needed to quickly add those parentheses when a function was not working properly and I needed to have a console.log put there to check the place it fails (`if (something) callMethod();`

In the end I've submitted my second result at :22 and quickly checked the leaderboards. Last person to submit a result did it at :04, so probably before I even finished reading the task description.
